# Data Tables Theme: Fiscal Data

Some of the more interesting initiatives in working with open data target transparency in government revenue and expenditure.

For the 'Fiscal Data' Data Table theme, We will identify a range of important fiscal datasets for use,  potentially address gaps and contribute suggestions for advancement in existing open fiscal data work

## Datasets

- [Open Spending](https://openspending.org) is a treasure trove, with 1100+ datasets from 75 countries at this time
- [USA Spending site by the US government](https://www.usaspending.gov/Pages/Default.aspx)
- [Global Open Data Index](http://index.okfn.org/dataset/)

## Interesting things that can be done

- Contribute additional/newer datasets
 -  [to Open Spending](https://openspending.org/datasets/new)
 - [to Subsidy Stories, open a Github issue](https://github.com/os-data/eu-structural-funds/issues)
-

## Add context

- How do these collection datasets relate to each other?
- How is the same artist, location, medium, etc. represented across datasets?
